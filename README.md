# ZNO_Lviv_schools-Project

The project uses the official ZNO (external independent evaluation of Ukrainian school graduates). 
the full dataset can be downloaded at: https://zno.testportal.com.ua/stat/2017

The code takes Lviv regional data; a user defines schools of interest (either as manually-composed list or by city regions) and produces
boxplots of test results by school of interest, and the number of students who took the certain test. 

Python skills: - data frames operations, summarizing data frames, composing a new data frame as summary of the old one
- visualization: seaborn, graphs tuning, subplots, annotations, heatmap
